<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am a second-year Master student at <b>Columbia University</b>, working closely with <a href="https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/sunil-agrawal">Prof. Sunil K. Agrawal</a>. My major is Mechanical Engineering, and I as a research assistant in <a href="https://roar.me.columbia.edu/">ROAR Lab</a> since the fall of 2021. While working in ROAR Lab, my research project is mainly about applying human pose and hand pose estimation in the medical field. My research interest is Robot Learning, especially Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. Before coming to Columbia, I received a B.E. degree at the Civil Aviation University of China. </p>
